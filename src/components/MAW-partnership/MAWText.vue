      After a successful program with three local Make-A-Wish chapters (Arizona,
      Nebraska, and Central & Northern Florida)—raising almost $90,000—the free
      Prescription Discount Card program benefiting Make-A-Wish was extended to
      all 59 chapters across the United States as of November 1, 2014. We
      started this program so Make-A-Wish could have an additional source of
      funding for the important work they do creating life-changing wishes for
      children with critical illnesses. Donations stay in the communities in
      which they are raised to help grant wishes locally.
